# General Guidelines:

- For each assignment you should create a directory named hw*N* where *N* is
  the homework number, *e.g.* homework 0, should be stored in a directory named
  hw0.
- Once you are done with an assignment and you are ready to submit it, tag it,
  and push your tag to GitHub. We only grade the tagged assignments.
- The name of the tags should reflect the assignment number, for example for
  **hw0** your tag should be named **hw0**.
- There should be one tag per assignment, in case there were more, we grade the
  last one .


# Tagging:

- To list the available tags: `git tag`
- To create a tag: `git tag TAG_NAME`
  Where *TAG_NAME* is the name of the tag
- To push your tags (submit): `git push origin TAG_NAME`
